This project is a simple and efficient Task Management Application built using Python. The app allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks in an organized way. It helps users manage their daily activities by storing tasks, marking them as completed, and keeping track of deadlines or priorities.
The application uses core Python concepts such as functions, file handling, lists, and dictionaries to manage task data. Tasks can be saved to a file so that the user’s progress is not lost when the program closes. A menu-driven interface makes it easy for users to interact with the system, ensuring smooth navigation between adding tasks, viewing all tasks, editing entries, and deleting completed ones.
This project demonstrates essential Python skills including data storage, user input handling, functional programming, and basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It is a useful beginner-friendly project that showcases how Python can be used to build real-world productivity applications.
